S2ResiliencyAndroid
===================

Sample Android Chat Room App which illustrates the usage of connection resiliency APIs.

This is based on our similar project which works with the AppWarp cloud servers. It is described in detail in the this [blog post](http://blogs.shephertz.com/2013/10/30/how-to-handle-connection-issues-in-android-devices-while-developing-multiplayer-games-appwarp/).

This sample is a port of that using the AppWarp S2 client SDK instead and has been tested with the default AppWarp S2 application (i.e. one that doesn't have additional authentication logic).

The file [Constants.java](https://github.com/DhruvCShepHertz/S2ResiliencyAndroid/blob/master/Resilient_Chat/src/appwarp/example/Constants.java) needs to be configured with the details of the AppWarp S2 instance that you are running the client against.
